I finally came back to finish the project and I'm happy to know that
I was able to finish it. So what have I learned? Use divs for everything,
flexboxes are your best friends, flexbox wrappers too if you want extra
detail underneath flex item, margin: 0 auto; if you want a centered div,
properly name your classes so you're not confused instead of giving them
random names and for class names do this, class-name, instead of this,
class_name
