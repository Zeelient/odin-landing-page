I finally came back to finish the project and I'm happy to know that
I was able to finish it. So what have I learned? Use divs for everything,
flexboxes are your best friends, flexbox wrappers too if you want extra
detail underneath flex item, margin: 0 auto; if you want a centered div,
properly name your classes so you're not confused instead of giving them
random names and for class names do this, class-name, instead of this,
class_name


Ok, so for some reason with the Github live preview, there are no margins or
padding for the placeholder to stop it from touching the right side of the page,
same with the section4 items. I can't be bothered to fix it, just download the files
and test the live server in VSC. RIght now, the Github live preview is not accurate
